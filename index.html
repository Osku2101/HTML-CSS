        <p>In both the Rhode Island and Swiss tragedies, a "flashover fire" is thought to have taken hold. This is when hot air rises, but as the heat and smoke reach the ceiling there is nowhere for it to go. So it spreads downwards, quickly igniting furniture, clothes and skin. In 2003, Phil Barr was 22, back home in Rhode Island for a winter break after living in New York. He was set on a career on Wall Street, but Phil loved a loud rock band, so going to see Great White that night sounded, well, great.</p>
        <p>He got there early and when his friend arrived shortly before show time, Phil grabbed him a beer and excitedly propelled him to the front of the crowd.As the fire began, the band's lead singer turned and said, calmly over the PA system: "Wow, that's not good."</p>
        <p>It wasn't. Phil describes the moment of the "flashover", saying flames quickly "got overhead, and it was above me".</p>
